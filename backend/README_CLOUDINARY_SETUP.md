# Cloudinary Setup for Public Video Sharing

## Problem
The current local storage solution (`http://10.92.112.87:3000/videos/`) only works on your local network. Friends outside your network cannot access these video links.

## Solution: Cloudinary Integration

Cloudinary offers:
- ✅ **Free tier**: 25 GB storage, 25 GB bandwidth/month
- ✅ **Public URLs**: Videos accessible from anywhere
- ✅ **Video optimization**: Automatic compression and format conversion
- ✅ **CDN**: Fast global delivery

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account
1. Go to [https://cloudinary.com/](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Get API Credentials
1. Log into your Cloudinary dashboard
2. Go to "Dashboard" or "Settings"
3. Copy these values:
   - **Cloud Name**
   - **API Key**
   - **API Secret**

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret
```

### Step 4: Test the Setup
1. Restart your backend server
2. Try uploading a video through your app
3. The video should now get a public URL like: `https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/video/upload/v1234567890/safeher-videos/video_1234567890.mp4`

## How It Works

1. **Primary**: Videos upload to Cloudinary → Public URL
2. **Fallback**: If Cloudinary fails → Local storage (for development)

## Benefits

- 🌍 **Global Access**: Videos accessible from anywhere
- 🚀 **Fast Loading**: CDN delivery
- 📱 **Mobile Optimized**: Automatic format conversion
- 🔒 **Secure**: Private API keys
- 💰 **Free**: Generous free tier

## Troubleshooting

### "Unknown API key" Error
- Check your `.env` file has correct credentials
- Restart the server after updating `.env`
- Verify credentials in Cloudinary dashboard

### Upload Fails
- Check internet connection
- Verify file size (Cloudinary free tier has limits)
- Check Cloudinary account status

## Alternative Solutions

If Cloudinary doesn't work, consider:
1. **Google Drive API** (with proper billing setup)
2. **AWS S3** (with billing)
3. **Dropbox API** (free tier available)
4. **YouTube API** (for video sharing)

## Current Status

✅ Cloudinary integration implemented
✅ Fallback to local storage working
⏳ Waiting for Cloudinary credentials setup
